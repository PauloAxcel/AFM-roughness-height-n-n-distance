# AFM-roughness-height-n-n-distance
In this work we extracted information from AFM measurements. We  are observing a patterned formation in the AFM, however this pattern formation sometimes is not uniform. AFM measurements are processed with Gwyddian(R) software, were we will select one slice of the profile and save the data (length, height) in a csv. If the patterned is not completly formed, the patterned is bell shapped. When the patterned is complete the patterned is cylindrical shapped. One way to analyse these non-uniform patterns is by apply a gaussian fit in the height profile, thus obtaining information about the height, the thickness of the pattern and the distance between neightbour patterns.
